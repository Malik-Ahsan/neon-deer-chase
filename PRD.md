## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** ResumePivot

**Primary Users:** Job candidates with diverse, transferable skills applying to multiple role types (e.g., Product Manager, Program Manager, Partnerships Manager).

---

### 1. Problem Statement

Experienced candidates often have lengthy resumes with mixed or irrelevant details. When applying to adjacent but distinct job titles, they need tailored resumes and cover letters that highlight relevant experiences by functional role (e.g., program manager, product manager) & domain/industry (e.g., payments, education). Current tools force heavy manual editing and make version control difficult. Candidates also lack accessible ways to structure compelling narratives and prepare effectively for interviews.

---

### 2. Goals & Objectives

*   Help candidates create job-specific resumes and cover letters quickly.
*   Provide centralized management via a master resume with structured tagging.
*   Enable consistency across versions with smart syncing.
*   Offer premium guided services (voice-to-text capture, coaching, interview prep) as part of the long-term product vision.
*   Monetize via subscriptions, one-off coaching, and executive packages, confirming these are key components of the overall business strategy.
